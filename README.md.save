# 🌀 3D Maze Game – Unity3D

## 📖 Overview

This project is a **3D Maze Game** developed in **Unity3D (C#)** as part of a programming assignment.
The player navigates through a textured 3D maze using standard **first-person shooter (FPS)** controls.
The maze contains a **start point**, an **exit goal**, and an **enemy** that moves independently throughout the maze.

When the player reaches the goal, a message appears indicating **victory**.

## 👾 Enemy Behavior

* The **enemy** is a 3D animated model with a walking/running animation loop.
* It moves through open maze corridors using a simple **path-following or random-walk AI**.
* When the player resets using the **HOME** key or **gamepad button**, the enemy also returns to its spawn point.

---

## 🧠 Technical Notes

* **Engine:** Unity 2022+

* **Language:** C#

* **Scene Objects:**

  * `MazeGenerator` (creates the grid and walls)
  * `PlayerController` (handles movement, input, noclip toggle, and reset)
  * `EnemyControllerFSM` (handles enemy pathfinding/animation)
  * `GoalTrigger` (detects player reaching the exit)

* **Materials:**

  * `WallNorth`, `WallSouth`, `WallEast`, `WallWest` – distinct textures for each wall face.
  * `Floor` – separate material/texture.

* **Collision System:**

  * Uses Unity’s built-in **CharacterController** for movement and wall detection.
  * Noclip mode temporarily disables collisions for free movement.

* **Victory Detection:**

  * Trigger collider on goal object displays UI text or panel saying **“You Win!”**.

---

## 🧾 Development Notes

* Maze generation tested with both **fixed layout** (for debugging) and **procedural generation**.
* Player and enemy spawn points verified to be unblocked by walls.
* Game runs on **Windows standalone build** (x86/x64).
* Textures applied via **Material instances** with different shaders for walls/floor.
* Tested with both **keyboard** and **Xbox/PlayStation controllers**.
